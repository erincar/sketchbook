# sketchbook

My interactive sketchbook, powered by [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit)
, [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), and potentially more in the future.

## TODO

- [ ] Sketchbook cover page
- [ ] Sketch Routing with slugs
- [ ] Three.js
- [ ] Phaser / Other Canvas wrapper?
- [ ] Physics Engine?
- [ ] Procedural Audio: WebAudio API? Library?
